<h2><font color="#9a4e4e">Using Dictionary from other programs</font></h2>
<p>You can use Odia-English to look up words in most Windows programs. To do this you 
must have used the default installation program to run from the system tray. </p>
<p><b>One-click look up (using the mouse)</b> </p>
<ol>
	<li>Hold down the Ctrl key, right click with the mouse on the word you want 
	to look up</li>
</ol> 
<p><b>Look up a selected word (using the keyboard)</b> </p>
<ol>
	<li>Select the word or collocation you want to look up. <br>
	<i>In most programs you can double click with the mouse to do this</i>. 
	</li>
</ol>
<p>In some programs you can replace the selected word by pressing the Replace 
button in the Dictionary window after you have chosen an alternative. You can also 
do this in MS Word and rich edit controls using the one-click look up method.</p>
